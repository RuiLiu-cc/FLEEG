# FLEEG
This is the PyTorch implementation of the FLEEG in our paper:

Rui Liu, Yuanyuan Chen, Anran Li, Yi Ding, Han Yu, Cuntai Guan, "Aggregating Intrinsic Information to Enhance BCI Performance
through Federated Learning", accepted as a regular paper in the Neural Networks, 2024.

We are currently cleaning up the code. It will be released here soon.
