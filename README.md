## ‚öôÔ∏è Dataset Preprocessing

- For the KU, SHU, BCI2a and Murat2018 dataset, please download them from the website first, save them to the corresponding folder, and use the provided code to do preprocessing.

- For the Shin, Weibo2014, Cho2017, MunichMI and Schirrmeister2017 datasets, they can be downloaded using the provided code directly, followed by the preprocessing.
